    "Brief explanation of each hyperparameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `batch_size`: This hyperparameter defines the number of independent sequences processed in parallel during each training iteration. It impacts the granularity of parameter updates and memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `block_size`: This hyperparameter specifies the maximum length of sequences that the model can process. It determines the context length for predictions and affects the model's ability to capture dependencies within sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `max_iters`: This hyperparameter sets the maximum number of training iterations or epochs. It controls the duration of training and helps prevent overfitting by limiting the number of updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `eval_interval`: This hyperparameter determines how often the model's performance is evaluated during training. It affects the frequency of monitoring training progress and validation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `learning_rate`: This hyperparameter controls the step size or rate at which the model parameters are updated during optimization. It influences the convergence speed and stability of the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `device`: This hyperparameter specifies the device (CPU or GPU) on which the model computations are performed. It allows for efficient utilization of available hardware resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `eval_iters`: This hyperparameter determines the number of iterations between each evaluation of the model's performance. It can be used to reduce computational overhead during evaluation while still providing frequent updates on model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `n_embd`: This hyperparameter defines the dimensionality of the embedding layer. It determines the size of the vector representations for tokens in the input sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `n_head`: This hyperparameter specifies the number of attention heads in the multi-head attention mechanism used in the transformer architecture. It controls the model's ability to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `n_layer`: This hyperparameter sets the number of transformer layers in the model. It determines the depth of the model and its capacity to capture complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. `dropout`: This hyperparameter defines the probability of dropping out neurons during training. It helps prevent overfitting by regularizing the model and reducing co-adaptation between neurons. A value of 0.0 means no dropout is applied, while higher values introduce more dropout."

    "The `estimate_loss` function serves to compute the average loss on both the training and validation datasets without engaging in gradient computation. By temporarily disabling gradient calculations and setting the model to evaluation mode, it iterates through the data splits, samples batches, and computes losses over multiple evaluation iterations. The function then returns a dictionary containing the mean losses for each split. This approach efficiently assesses the model's performance without updating its parameters and is crucial for monitoring training progress and model validation."

    "The `Block` class represents a single Transformer block, which is a fundamental building block of the Transformer architecture. Below is an explanation of its architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Architecture**:\n",
    "  - **Multi-Head Self-Attention Module**: The block initializes a multi-head self-attention module (`sa`), which consists of multiple attention heads operating in parallel. Each attention head independently attends to different parts of the input sequence, allowing the model to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.\n",
    "  - **Feedforward Neural Network Module**: It also initializes a feedforward neural network module (`ffwd`), which consists of linear layers followed by ReLU activation and dropout. This component introduces non-linearity and enables the model to capture complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "  - **Layer Normalization Modules**: Two layer normalization modules (`ln1` and `ln2`) are initialized. Layer normalization normalizes the activations of each layer, helping stabilize the training process and improve model performance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Functionality**:\n",
    "  - **Forward Pass**: In the `forward` method, the input tensor (`x`) is passed through the multi-head self-attention module (`sa`). The output is then passed through layer normalization (`ln1`) and added to the input tensor (`x`) to form a residual connection.\n",
    "  - **Feedforward Network**: Next, the output from the attention module is passed through the feedforward neural network (`ffwd`). Again, the output is passed through layer normalization (`ln2`) and added to the previous output to form another residual connection.\n",
    "  - **Output**: The final output of the Transformer block represents the processed input tensor, capturing both the self-attention and feedforward network transformations."

    "  - **Token Embedding Layer**: Initializes an embedding layer (`token_embedding_table`) to map token indices to dense vector representations. The size of the embedding matrix is determined by the vocabulary size (`vocab_size`) and the embedding dimension (`n_embd`).\n",
    "  - **Position Embedding Layer**: Creates another embedding layer (`position_embedding_table`) to encode positional information into the input tokens. This layer assigns a unique position embedding to each token position in the sequence.\n",
    "  - **Transformer Blocks**: Utilizes a sequence of Transformer blocks (`blocks`) to process the input sequence. Each block consists of multi-head self-attention followed by feedforward neural network layers, facilitating the capture of contextual dependencies and patterns within the input sequence.\n",
    "  - **Layer Normalization**: Applies layer normalization (`ln_f`) after the Transformer blocks to stabilize the learning process and improve model performance.\n",
    "  - **Linear Layer for Language Modeling**: Defines a linear layer (`lm_head`) to project the output of the Transformer blocks to the vocabulary size, producing logits for each token in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functionality**:\n",
    "  - **Forward Pass**: In the `forward` method, the input tensor (`idx`) containing token indices is passed through the token embedding layer and added to position embeddings. The resulting tensor is then processed by the Transformer blocks and layer normalization, followed by the linear layer to compute logits for language modeling. If targets are provided, the method also computes the cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "  - **Token Generation**: The `generate` method generates new tokens by iteratively predicting the next token based on the previous sequence. It repeatedly samples from the softmax distribution of logits for the last token and appends the sampled token to the sequence until the specified maximum number of new tokens is generated."
